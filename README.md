## Problem Statement

At FAST University, managing student societies presents several challenges:

- Fragmented communication across different platforms.
- Disjointed event organization and tracking.
- Lack of centralized management for registrations, updates, and notifications.
- Time-consuming manual handling of events and members.
- Insufficient tracking of member participation and performance, making it hard to recognize and reward active members.

This inefficiency negatively impacts student engagement and participation in extracurricular activities, reducing the vibrancy of campus life.
